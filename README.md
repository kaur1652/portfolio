##  Interview Insight: The Development Process

###  My Process

When creating this portfolio, I followed a structured, mobile-first design approach. I began with low-fidelity wireframes and gradually transformed them into a live, responsive website using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap. My focus was on accessibility, clean structure, and clear navigation so that users could easily understand who I am and what I offer.

The process included:

- Sketching and planning layout with responsiveness in mind.
- Organizing content for Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact pages.
- Writing semantic HTML for accessibility and structure.
- Styling with Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- Adding animations for visual interest using animation libraries.
- Testing on different devices and browsers to ensure responsiveness.

## Challenges & How I Overcame Them

### 1. **Responsiveness Issues**
Initially, the layout would break on smaller screens. I solved this by using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system and testing with Chrome DevTools on various breakpoints.

### 2. **Animation Timing**
I struggled to get the scroll-based animations (AOS) to look smooth and professional. I fixed this by experimenting with AOS attributes like `delay`, `duration`, and `easing` to fine-tune the user experience.

### 3. **Keeping Code Organized**
Managing multiple CSS files and HTML pages became difficult. I overcame this by using consistent class naming conventions, sectioning my code clearly with comments, and separating reset styles from custom styles.

### 4. **Linking External Assets Correctly**
Some animation libraries and icon fonts didnâ€™t load properly at first. I checked the CDN links, placed them in the correct order in the `<head>`, and ensured the internet connection was stable for testing.
